      "Superb writing. Had it not been for sleep, i would have completed this book in a single sitting. The pacing is good and maintains the reader's attention.",

      "Easy read- definitely got me interested to buy the next one. But not as intriguing as Shiva as of now",
      "Notwithstanding the contemporary politics that has been embedded into the book rather crudely, the story is still delightful and leaves you in awe of the Scion of Ikshvaku, Prabhu Shri Ram."

      "After the long wait of 2 years, finally yesterday, 'Sita - Warrior Of Mithila ' was delivered to me ( at 1556 hours ) and I started the book in the late evening and wrapped it in a single sitting. Like the spell bounded the first installment of the Ram Chandra Series, Sita-Warrior of Mithila 'reads with the speed tantamount to any fifth-generation fighter jet. The depiction of a woman warrior justifies the title of the book.",
      "good book to read. it's nice how author explained ramayan in his own version. good work by Amish ji.",
      "Below expectations and that's not good at all as my expectations were already low after reading the first book of the series.",
